## bof1.c
No vulnerabilities detected.

## gets.c
Vulnerabilities Detected:
1. Unchecked user input: The gets() function is used to read user input without any bounds checking, which can lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
2. Lack of input validation: The grantAccess() function is not properly validating user input, which can lead to an authentication bypass.

## example1.c
Vulnerabilities Detected:
1. Lack of input validation - The scanf() function does not validate user input, which could lead to a buffer overflow attack.
2. Lack of sanitization - The Sanitize() function is not implemented, which could lead to a SQL injection attack.

## sprintf.c
Vulnerabilities Detected:
1. Unchecked return value of sprintf() - The return value of sprintf() is not checked, which could lead to a buffer overflow.
2. Uninitialized variable - The variable 'check' is used without being initialized, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
3. Unsafe use of printf() - The printf() function is used with an external link, which could lead to a potential security vulnerability.

## strcpy.c
Vulnerabilities Detected:
1. Buffer Overflow: str1 is only 10 characters long, but str2 is 15 characters long. Copying str2 into str1 could cause a buffer overflow.
2. Unchecked Input: str2 is a hard-coded string, so it is not checked for malicious input.
